- need of the model
- graph/ table showing the road accident analysis of past years
- how model can do it
- how diff it is? it considers all the factors + does in real time
- used in smart vehicles - future

-definition of the all model
   - Linear regression
   - Multinomial naive bayes classification
 

-formula of linear regression
- SSr , SSb , SSe
- Maths for multinomial naive bayes


- describe the data
     - column wise meaning of data

- analysis of data
    - how much does each column contributes to the target column
    - each column with the accident severity

- changes done in the data
     - removing of irrelevant data
     - merging the data which was not done till now
     - considered all conditions (weather, road, vehicle)
     - removing null values - so that accuracy is not risked

- flow of the model
    -each step from preprocessing 
    - flow  of the model for calculation
    - for prediction tried variations:
	- train and test set percent
	- regression and classification model
	- accuracy table of all

- run the regression on the excel:
    - calculate anova, error, score all in table form

- flow of the model for prediction in real time
    - with words
    - flow chart
