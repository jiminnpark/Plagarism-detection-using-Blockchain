Most articles consist of paragraphs and images (perhaps with other types of audiovisual media). However, articles may also be formatted as stand-alone lists or tables (not to be confused with disambiguation pages, which are purely navigation aids). These lists or tables are also considered articles for Wikipedia's purposes and are included in the Main/Article namespace, the one without a title prefix followed by a colon (:).

The following items are not counted as articles (see also Wikipedia:Administration ยง Data structure and development):

disambiguation pages,
redirect pages,
templates, including navboxes (aka navigation boxes),
user pages,
drafts,
portals,
talk pages (aka discussion pages),
file pages for media such as images,
category pages,
help pages, and
Wikipedia policies and guidelines pages (along with everything else in the Wikipedia: namespace).
